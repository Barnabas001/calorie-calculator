**Project Origin**
This project was created as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, specifically for the "Build a Calorie Counter" challenge in the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification track. It demonstrates practical application of DOM manipulation, form handling, and basic arithmetic operations in JavaScript.

**Overview**
The Calorie Counter is a web application that helps users track their daily calorie intake and expenditure. Users can set a daily calorie budget, add food entries for different meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks), and log exercise activities. The application calculates the remaining calories and displays whether the user is in a calorie surplus or deficit.

**Features**
Set a daily calorie budget
Add multiple food entries for different meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)
Log exercise activities
Calculate remaining calories based on intake and expenditure
Visual indication of calorie surplus (red) or deficit (green)
Clear form functionality to reset all inputs

**FreeCodeCamp Requirements Met**
This project fulfills the following FreeCodeCamp user stories:
Can add entries for different meals/exercise categories
Validates numeric input
Calculates calorie totals and remaining calories
Displays results clearly
Includes clear form functionality

**Technologies Used**
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript (ES6)

**Installation**
No installation is required. Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

**Usage**
Enter your daily calorie budget in the "Budget" field
Use the dropdown menu to select a meal category (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks, or Exercise)
Click "Add Entry" to add items to the selected category
For each entry:
Enter a name (for food items)
Enter the calorie amount (positive for food, negative for exercise)
Click "Calculate Remaining Calories" to see your results
Use "Clear" button to reset the form

**File Structure**
index.html: Main HTML file containing the application structure
styles.css: CSS file containing all styling rules
script.js: JavaScript file containing all application logic

**Code Highlights**
Dynamic form generation with JavaScript
Input validation to prevent invalid entries
Responsive design with CSS Flexbox
Color-coded output for surplus/deficit states
Event listeners for user interactions

**License**
This project is open-source and available for anyone to use or modify, following FreeCodeCamp's academic honesty policy.

**Future Improvements**
Add persistence using localStorage
Include a database of common foods with pre-calculated calories
Add charts for visualizing calorie trends
Implement user accounts for multi-user support
Add mobile responsiveness improvements
